### Objective ‚úç
Objective is to build an application for all Book Lovers ‚ô• like me out there where all you have to
do is input book name application will recommend you some books that you may **loveüòç to read**.
If you are searching for top popular books then there is a section of top 100 book based on popularity where you can find the right one for you.

### Dataset üßæ
The Dataset that I used for this task is [Book-recommendation dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset). It contains over 10k books with over 1million total ratings. It consists of three files Books.csv, Ratings.csv, Users.csv.

### Features

- **Book Recommendations:** Users can input a book name, and the system will recommend a few books similar to the input book.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy to navigate and use.

### How It Works
- **Data Collection:** The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes books, ratings and users.
- **Data Preprocessing:** The data is cleaned and prepared for model training.
- **Model Training:** The collaborative filtering model is trained on the collected data.
- **Recommendations:** When a user inputs a book name, the model suggests books similar to the input book.
- **Popularity Display:** The top 100 books are displayed based on their popularity scores from the dataset.

### Technologies Used
